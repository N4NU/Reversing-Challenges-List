mdZero says that he has tons of excellent tools. However, he has never showed his magic to us before. "They are all stored in my mobile HDD. At home, not here". That's what he told us when we were asking, every time!
Once, we forced him to tell us, or he would be sent to cops. Then he take out this one from his pocket. Could you help me to figure out what is it?
